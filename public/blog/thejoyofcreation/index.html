<h1 id="here-s-a-test-post">Here's a Test Post</h1>
<p>This site was built with <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola SSG</a>. I don't know why I went for this instead of <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. They seem equal in functionality and for my purposes, I didn't even really need an SSG to be frank. It's all just a bunch of HTML and CSS. The markdown stuff is neat but not super needed.</p>
<p>Anyways, this is just a test post. I don't have the energy in me to write something proper yet, but I do intend to move some of my notes for game design and my art showcases to this site eventually. Promise! ðŸ˜Š</p>
